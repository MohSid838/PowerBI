# 🏦 Home Loan Analytics Dashboard -- Power BI

This project presents a comprehensive **Home Loan Analytics Dashboard**
built in **Power BI**, designed to help financial institutions track
loan performance across application, sanction, disbursal, and recovery
stages.\
The dashboard enables banking teams, analysts, and management to monitor
KPIs, customer demographics, product performance, and operational
efficiency across channels and branches.

## 📊 Business Objective

Banks and NBFCs handle large volumes of home loan applications. Tracking
their full lifecycle manually leads to:

-   Lack of visibility into approval funnel leakages\
-   Inefficient product/channel/branch performance monitoring\
-   Missing insights on customer repayment behavior\
-   Slow decision-making due to scattered data systems

This Power BI solution provides a **360° view of the loan portfolio**,
consolidating data from multiple systems into an interactive,
data-driven dashboard.
